== Overview

A simple solution to make _bad-ansible_ more modular, maintainable etc. 

Basically the approach is to take the original playbook and break it into
smaller parts through a series in `import_playbook` statements. However for 
postgresql a galaxy role was used, in this case the popular geerlingguy.postgresql
role.

The `ansible.cfg` sets an external `ssh.cfg` file so you will need to edit the `ssh.cfg`:

. set the correct GUID for your lab
. set the correct user
. if necessary set the correct key
. set it for the correct type of ssh access, direct or via jumpbox. See below

=== Usage

ansible-playbook site.yml -e GUID=<YOUR_GUID>


=== Notes on `ssh` and Jumpbox v. Direct

This solution can be run in 3 ways:

. From the bastion server
. From your laptop or external control node (VM or other external server)
** Using the externall FQDNs 
** Using the bastion host as a jumpbox i.e. using the unroutable internal IPs
